# Fast-Paced-Unreal-FPS
 DOOM 2016/DOOM Eternal inspired game made in Unreal Engine 5.4.4

# Project History/Context
 This project was made for my High-school Capstone Project. I started working on it on October 1st, but then ended up having
 to restart development on November 5th due to a project corruption. This project should hopefully be finished by December 10, which means
 that I only really have two months to work on this project.

# Why is the project called "EngineSucks"
 Originally when I was programming the project I had it under a different name and a different version of Unreal. 
 However, that project ended up getting corrupted. This lead to me restarting the project and calling it "EngineSucks"
 because I was mad at Unreal for being stupid.
